== TAZAMON

In the age of the cloud providers; end-user's contacts and calendars end up scattered. One contact ended up with several dads and meetings always collide.
Having multiple cloud accounts specially if one of them is a work account drive you to dust business and lost socks in the washing machines.
Tazamon aims to put an end to this by unifying and syncing all the cloud providers contacts and calendars together.
